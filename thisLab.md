## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Exercise: The Recursive Cashier (Direct Recursion)**
### **Problem Statement:**
A cashier needs to give change using the fewest number of coins. Given an amount `N` and a set of coin denominations `{1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100}`, write a recursive function to compute the minimum number of coins needed.

### **Tasks:**
- Write a recursive function `minCoins(N, coins)` that finds the minimum number of coins.
- Analyze its complexity and explain why recursion may not be the best approach.
- Optimize it using memoization.

### **Expected Output:**
```python
minCoins(47, [1, 5, 10, 25])  # Output: 5 (25 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1)
```

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Exercise: Virus Spread (Head Recursion)**
### **Problem Statement:**
A computer virus spreads exponentially every hour. If a system starts with `P` infected computers, and each infected computer infects two new computers every hour, how many infected computers will there be after `N` hours?

### **Tasks:**
- Write a head-recursive function `virusSpread(N, P)`.
- Determine the time complexity.
- Modify the recursion to an iterative approach and compare efficiency.

### **Expected Output:**
```python
virusSpread(3, 1)  # Output: 15 (1 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 7 ‚Üí 15)
```

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Exercise: The Tail-Recursive Factorial (Tail Recursion)**
### **Problem Statement:**
Factorial calculation is commonly done using direct recursion, but it can be optimized using tail recursion to avoid stack overflow.

### **Tasks:**
- Implement a tail-recursive factorial function.
- Compare it with a non-tail-recursive version.
- Analyze the complexity and discuss why tail recursion is more memory-efficient.

### **Expected Output:**
```python
factorial(5)  # Output: 120
```

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Exercise: Pascal‚Äôs Triangle (Nested Recursion)**
### **Problem Statement:**
Pascal‚Äôs Triangle is defined as:

\[ C(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k) \]

with base cases:

\[ C(n, 0) = C(n, n) = 1 \]

### **Tasks:**
- Write a nested recursive function `pascal(n, k)` to compute Pascal‚Äôs Triangle.
- Analyze the complexity and suggest an iterative approach.
- Print Pascal‚Äôs Triangle up to `n = 5`.

### **Expected Output:**
```plaintext
1  
1 1  
1 2 1  
1 3 3 1  
1 4 6 4 1  
```

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Exercise: File System Depth (Tree Recursion)**
### **Problem Statement:**
A computer file system can be represented as a tree. Each folder contains files or subfolders. Given a nested directory structure, compute the maximum depth of the file system.

### **Example:**
```python
file_system = {
    "home": {
        "user": {
            "documents": {
                "project": {
                    "file1.txt": None,
                    "file2.txt": None
                }
            }
        },
        "downloads": {
            "movie.mp4": None
        }
    }
}
```

### **Tasks:**
- Write a tree-recursive function `maxDepth(fs)` to compute the depth.
- Analyze the complexity and compare with an iterative BFS approach.

### **Expected Output:**
```python
maxDepth(file_system)  # Output: 4
```

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Exercise: Two-Way Communication (Indirect Recursion)**
### **Problem Statement:**
A phone call alternates between caller and receiver until the conversation ends. The caller speaks first, then the receiver replies, then the caller again, and so on. If the caller starts with `n` sentences, and each reply is `n-1` until `n=0`, simulate the conversation using indirect recursion.

### **Tasks:**
- Write two mutually recursive functions `caller(n)` and `receiver(n)`.
- Print a conversation simulation where each side speaks alternately.

### **Expected Output:**
```python
caller(3)
# Output:
# Caller: I will speak 3 times.
# Receiver: I will reply 2 times.
# Caller: I will speak 1 time.
# Receiver: I will reply 0 times.
```

## **‚ú® Bonus Challenge: The Towers of Hanoi (Optimization & Complexity)**
### **Problem Statement:**
The classic Towers of Hanoi involves moving `N` disks from `A ‚Üí C`, using `B` as an auxiliary. The goal is to minimize the number of moves.

### **Tasks:**
- Write a recursive solution for `hanoi(N, A, B, C)`.
- Prove that the minimum number of moves is \(O(2^N - 1)\).
- Implement a memoized version and analyze its impact.

### **Expected Output:**
```python
hanoi(3, 'A', 'B', 'C')
# Output:
# Move disk 1 from A to C
# Move disk 2 from A to B
# Move disk 1 from C to B
# Move disk 3 from A to C
# Move disk 1 from B to A
# Move disk 2 from B to C
# Move disk 1 from A to C
```
