# **Recursion & Memoization - Practical Lab**

## **ðŸ“Œ Exercise 1: Fibonacci Sequence (Direct Recursion & Memoization)**
### **Problem Statement:**
Write a recursive function to compute the `n`th Fibonacci number using:
1. **Naive Recursion** (direct recursion)
2. **Memoization** to optimize it

---
## **ðŸ“Œ Exercise 2: Factorial (Head Recursion & Tail Recursion)**
### **Problem Statement:**
Write a recursive function to compute `n!` using:
1. **Head recursion** (process after recursive call)
2. **Tail recursion** (process before recursive call)

---
## **ðŸ“Œ Exercise 3: Sum of Digits (Nested Recursion)**
### **Problem Statement:**
Write a recursive function to compute the sum of digits of a number.

---
## **ðŸ“Œ Exercise 4: Tower of Hanoi (Tree Recursion)**
### **Problem Statement:**
Solve the Tower of Hanoi for `n` disks.

---
## **ðŸ“Œ Exercise 5: Indirect Recursion (Odd & Even Check)**
### **Problem Statement:**
Use **indirect recursion** to determine if a number is even or odd.

---
## **ðŸ“Œ Exercise 6: Minimum Coins Problem (Dynamic Programming with Memoization)**
### **Problem Statement:**
Find the minimum number of coins required to make `N` using a given set of denominations.
